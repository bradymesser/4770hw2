# Assignment 2

Team Members: 
William Hendrickson
Brady Messer
Bhavik Suthar

Compilation Instructions for Parallel Optimization:
: make module
: make
: make init16

# Team Roles
# Note group coding was done for all parts of project


- Brady Messer
    Wrote sequential implementation
    Helped witch code optimization by array access orders
    
- William Hendrickson
    Helped with parallel implementation and division of grid

- Bhavik Suthar
    Helped with MPI functions and processes
    Helped with code optimization by function calls
    
We all coded the parallel implementation together on one computer.
This helped us catch errors quickly, and reason through complicated aspects of the code
